"Stop Having Ideas and Start Counting Things"
framed as styolmetry
tools not necessarily object of analysis; hesitant to use methods not fully understood
who is audience? literary/cultural historians, poets (receptive to *basic* stats)
Grander the claim, more data needed>>need to determine, collect data oneself
"generate ones own data set">>"borrow one's lightly edited one" (e.g. critical edition, tagged online edition)
layers of intervention in a text (e.g. in ed notes at bottom of page)
making a list of halflines, noticed strange (but apparently necessary) editorial insertion in two places
whatever scribe had written the "incorrect" line twice appeared to believe that it had been metrical -- why misunderstand metrically? CLAIM hypothesis: writer had learned rule of meter from reading not oral tradition; hypothesis: two authors of text
stylometry with frequent (often function) words is common, but wouldn't work because hypothesis: author two was learning from author one -- even at level of metrical value of function words
most meter is same and samples small, so meter as measure of style is out
difficult to distinguish between faulty transmission, transcription; so word choice out
but alliterative habits! Mark Griffiths, meters of OE songs suggests allit on vowel is mark of weak poet
can check against existing Ross's counts "Philological Probability Problems" of alliteration in normative OE language
nod to relative sophistication of style: variation on 3x-vowel, multiple of common consonant, use of consonant
Is difficulty of style valuable to OE poetry?
Once find some pattern in text of interest, need to look at others to see whether normal or special patterns
throw out short texts bc hard to compare, throw out Beo bc "masterwork" and controversal; chose similar poems in subject matter, length
So found a pattern, but like how to represent it for other people, esp humanists? What viz shows what I am building my argument on?
Realize didn't matter which specific letters alliterate, but DISTRIBUTION (std dev) of letters
that 1st, 2nd, 3rd most common are alliterating (i.e. poet's favorites)
Harder for poet reading group 2 to write group 2 than vice versa -- ENTROPY
In a panic, had to find another poem that was agreed to be integral, definitely by one author
Excel: manage data, produce charts
Process of deciding what to count: forces clarity in concept of style/difficulty
Not trying to transform data set but describe/interpret
